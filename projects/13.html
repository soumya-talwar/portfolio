          <h3 class="py-3"><span class="extra">Thirteen</span> tells the story of some of my horrors as a non-binary child living in an all-girls' boarding school for eight years.<br><br>
            The resolve behind this project was to bring to the forefront deliberate dialogue around non-binary identities, around boarding facilities that seek to discipline than to nurture, to talk about menstruation and to challenge the shaming of non-masculine bodies and their self-pleasure.</h3>
          <h4 class="py-3">I don't believe boarding schools are designed as places of nurture for young students who are only beginning to discover and grow into themselves and their bodies. Historically, boarding schools have given the impression of strict disciplinary facilities. Parents spent their children to boarding schools to enforce what they considered normative behaviour in them but that thought has changed over time, and boarding schools are seen more as windows of opportunity, especially for families living in smaller towns. The major selling point of these schools is that they instil "character", self-confidence and self-reliance in their students. However, I find that the initial assessment of boarding schools was correct. These schools aren’t a place for finding yourself, refining your interests, or growing into who you are or want to be. Rather, they are places to become part of the whole, places where you are shamed and shunned until you ape everybody else and embody the "norm".<br><br>
            Moreover, the general idea in this country is that girls are "safe" when they're gathered and corralled away from the boys. The benefits of single-sex schools have been well documented. Students studying in same-sex institutes are more likely to develop high levels of self-confidence by experiencing an environment that frees them from the restrictions of gender stereotyping and harassment. But this kind of cisnormative thought enforces a rigid gender binary and erases the existence of trans and non-binary identities. Girls aren’t "safe" with other girls, least of all in a boarding school.<br><br>
            Being a cis-woman and living all 24 hours with your best friends and your bullies—who are often the same people—is hard enough. Being trans is a nightmare. By disconnecting students from the rest of the world, queer kids are left oppressed and confused, with no knowledge of ways of living alternate to the straight and cis ways those within the school live. And even though lack of queer education isn’t unique to boarding schools, with the better bulk of the child’s care—both physical and mental—falling to the school instead of the parents, there is a complete lack of resources available for students living in these oppressive environments.<br><br>
            While reading through several other queer people’s experiences about their lives in the boarding school, I came across one particular response that resonated in me: “I can never belong to anything, because for so many years I was forced to belong to the school. I wore their uniform, obeyed their rules, jumped out of bed and went running to the chapel or the refectory whenever they rang their bell.” And poignantly this person added, “I would rather live like a hermit than have anyone ever tell me what to do and when to do it.”
