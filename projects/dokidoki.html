						<span class="extra">Doki-doki</span> is an otome game where men get
						a chance to win a date with me.<br /><br />
						Since there are many men who haven't had the opportunity to date me,
						I thought I'd offer them a virtual experience of what it's like to
						go out with me.
					</h3>
					<h4 class="py-3">
						In an industry that predominantly caters to its male audience, otome
						games stand out as a popular exception in Japan that are marketed to
						young women. Otome games are story-based dating simulators that
						primarily use dialogue-based progression and typically feature a
						female protagonist who can develop a romantic relationship with one
						of the male supporting characters.<br /><br />
						An interesting aside is that "Soumya" is actually my fourth name. My
						third name was supposed to be "Simar" which means "to pray" in
						Hindi, but that was a time of no internet and my parents reached out
						to the closest English-speaking relative to confirm how my name
						should be spelt in English. This individual opened the Oxford
						Dictionary and gave my parents the spelling for "Simmer" (i.e.
						"boiling" in English). Added to that was my surname "Talwar" which
						means "sword" in Hindi, and it didn't help that I had a bad temper
						to compliment my name. My grandparents blamed my name, and my name
						was changed to "Soumya" which means "calm" in Hindi. I used to be a
						hot sword, and now I am a calm sword.<br /><br />
						Why this is relevant is because all dateable characters in the game
						have been given my names (Smriti, Simmer, and Soumya; Simran was
						another name, but due to its very short duration, it doesn't appear
						in the game). The personalities of these characters mirror the
						personalities I had when I held those names.<br /><br />
						The player progresses in the game by
						<span class="extra">conversing with me</span> like we would be on a
						date, and if they give the right answers, their contact details will
						be <span class="extra">shared with me over mail</span> and I can ask
						them out to a real date.
