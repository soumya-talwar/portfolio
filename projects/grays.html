          <h3 class="py-3">Grays is an advocacy of 128 non-binary genders that acquaints its viewers with the numerous relationships they can have with masculinity and femininity (both and neither), and the many different ways they can identify and express their gender regardless of the bodies they were born into.</h3>
          <h4 class="py-3">Gender is a social construct—and by that I mean that the measures by which characteristics, interests, mannerisms and behaviours are deemed “masculine” or “feminine” relies on people creating, believing and reinforcing these divisions.</h4>
          <h4 class="py-3">Our society isn’t binary: man or woman, male or female, masculine or feminine, no—real variation exists in every measurable attribute used to assign the categories of ‘male’ and ‘female’ to bodies. Facial hair, voice pitch, hormone levels, reproductive organs, external genitalia, as well as people who are intersex all prove that ‘biology’ is not a clear-cut basis for the gender binary.</h4>
          <h4 class="py-3">It is imperative to separate a person’s gender from their biological sex. A person’s sex refers to their anatomy—their reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics—but their gender identity is their internal, deeply held sense of their gender. And in the circumstances that an individual’s biological sex and their gender identity do not align, the person may identify as transgender, non-binary, or gender-nonconforming.</h4>
          <h4 class="py-3">As I worked on this project, I studied 128 different kinds of non-binary genders. I gave them all a binary encoding and plotted them in a three-dimensional space where each gender has a mathematical relationship with every other gender in the space. The intent behind this presentation is to illustrate that gender is not a toggle switch between male and female, nor is it a spectrum between masculinity and femininity. It is a multi-dimensional space that gives rise to countless diverse possibilities of identification and expression.</h4>
