							Hominidae is a series of interactive autonomous artworks that
							illustrate sexual violence and aggression seen in the Great
							Apes.<br /><br />
							However, at no point do I try to justify sexual violence as “good”
							or “correct” simply because similar behaviour is seen in non-human
							animals and is therefore natural. Just because something is a
							certain way that it ought to remain the same way is a flawed
							argument. The fact of the matter is sex and reproduction is
							unfair. It wasn’t always the case. The first organisms to evolve
							were in the sea, unable to move. They’d spew out millions of
							gametes into the ocean with the hope that they’d meet. But that
							was hardly an efficient mechanism of reproduction, and eventually
							evolution separated the two sexes. The female built an egg with
							sufficient nutrients in it and the male worked to go find that
							egg.<br /><br />
							But once evolution proceeds, the whole animal can walk over and
							find a mate. If the eggs are already laid, the male simply needs
							to lay the sperms right on top of them, an act that hardly
							requires the amount of energy that the female is putting into her
							eggs. That’s where we start seeing an inequality between the two
							sexes. Females make a few eggs, and her eggs are very expensive
							and rare, but males still make many, many sperms, and his sperms
							are plentiful and cheap. Once they take these two different
							evolutionary routes, different reproductive strategies come into
							play for the both of them.<br /><br />
							Males compete with each other for dominance and use that dominant
							status to mate with the female. And females try to find the male
							with the best genes for their offspring, and in species where
							males fight for dominance, females choose the winners. The male
							that wins possesses some genes which allow him to win these
							fights—he's big and strong and has sharp teeth. And the female
							will choose the most violent male to father her children because
							then her offsprings will also become these big, violent &
							successful males.<br /><br />
							What happens then is that both the male and female reproductive
							strategies collude in increasing the violence a little bit in
							every generation. If the males are fighting each other, and
							reproductive success depends on winning these fights, then the
							males will tend to get larger. Which is when a second strategy for
							reproductive success comes into play, and that is that the male
							doesn’t need to fight the other males; he is bigger and larger
							than the female so he can just coerce the smaller female into
							mating. If this trait enters a species, the females begin choosing
							a male who is the most successful at coercing females for their
							offspring to inherit the same traits.
							<br /><br />Of the five species of primates in which sexual
							violence has been observed, four of those are the Great Apes. And
							Hominidae was conceived as a collection of artworks that
							computationally simulate the different forms of sexual violence
							seen in these ape species.
