						As a (demi) woman in my twenties, the better bulk of my
						conversations with my family during the pandemic had revolved around
						my marriage prospects. That I am a Mangalik didn't help matters
						either.<br /><br />
						For that reason, I decided to build myself
						<span class="extra">an ideal husband</span> and bring him home to my
						family.
					</h3>
					<h4 class="py-3">
						Jyotisha is the traditional Hindu system of astrology, and it plays
						a sizeable role in deciding marriageable matches across India today.
						A person born under the influence of Mars (Mangal) as per Hindu
						astrology is said to have "Mangal Dosh"; such a person is called a
						Mangalik. According to Hindu astrologers, marriage between a
						Mangalik and a non-Mangalik is disastrous and can even lead to an
						early death of the non-Mangalik individual.<br /><br />
						But if a Mangalik and a non-Mangalik couple were to insist to marry,
						to prevent the imminent disaster, in various parts of the country
						the Mangalik individual is made to marry a tree, an animal, or
						another inanimate object. It is believed that all evil effects
						resulting from the Mangal Dosh will then befall on the mock
						"spouse", and their subsequent marriage to a human will be a
						successful one.<br /><br />
						As it so happens, my birth chart declares me a Mangalik, but the
						thought of possibly being made to marry a tree isn’t displeasing to
						me. In fact, I can't think of a partner more ideal than a plant. And
						in four months, I built myself not one, but two ideal (money) plant
						husbands.<br /><br />
						Equipped with an image-classifying model that is trained to
						recognise my face, my husbands
						<span class="extra">can recognise me</span> with the help of a
						webcam when I stand in front of them. A natural language processor
						facilitates meaningful conversations between us. But these are not
						just any conversations. My husbands are designed to speak and
						respond to me just the way I desire from my ideal partners. (In
						fact, they speak to no one but me. I am a bit possessive like
						that.)<br /><br />
						These gentlemen are designed to have certain specific character
						traits that I selected for them. Jimin is the name of my first and
						original husband, and he's developed to be
						<span class="extra">sweet, amiable and lovable</span>. On the other
						hand, my second husband Seokjin is witty, charming, confident, and
						<span class="extra">speaks</span>
						<span class="extra">entirely</span> <span class="extra">in</span>
						<span class="extra">plant</span> <span class="extra">puns</span>.
						Moreover, the two of them have moods that vary based on their
						environment that they perceive with the help of sensors—a soil
						moisture sensor, a humidity and temperature sensor, and a light
						dependent resistor in particular.<br /><br />
						More husbands (surely named after more of BTS members) are yet to
						come and join the desktop application, Harem, where my husbands'
						digital personas live.<br /><br />
						For a thorough documentation of the four months I spent building my
						husbands,
